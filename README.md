# ðŸ§ª TMPP_Labs

A JavaScript-based project for studying and implementing software design patterns â€” part of the *Tehnici È™i Mecanisme de Proiectarea a Produselor Program* (TMPP) course.

## ðŸ“š Overview

This repository contains practical implementations of **three major categories** of design patterns:

### ðŸ”¨ Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** â€“ Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Builder** â€“ Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype** â€“ Creates object copies without knowing their exact classes.

### ðŸ§© Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** â€“ Converts one interface into another expected by clients.
- **Decorator** â€“ Dynamically adds behavior to objects.
- **Facade** â€“ Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### ðŸ§  Behavioral Patterns
- **Command** â€“ Encapsulates requests as objects.
- **Observer** â€“ Enables objects to subscribe to and receive notifications.
- **Strategy** â€“ Selects an algorithm at runtime.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Runs in any modern browser or Node.js environment
